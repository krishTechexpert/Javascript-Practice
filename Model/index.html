          <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a
            <a
              
              data-text="That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled
						and executed at runtime (e.g. when the browser executes the script)."
              class="info-modal"
              >dynamic, interpreted</a
            >
            and
            <a
              
              data-text="Weakly typed languages assign types (like 'number') to variables (data
						containers) at runtime - i.e. you (the developer) can't set the types
						you want to use in certain places in advance. Only indirectly by making
						sure you're always working with the correct values."
              class="info-modal"
              >weakly typed</a
            >
            programming language which was built with the purpose of running in
            host environments (e.g. inside of a webpage in the browser).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's part of pretty much any page you visit in the web as it's the
            only "thing" in web development that allows you (= the developer) to
            change something on the page at runtime. Basically everytime
            something opens, closes, moves or changes on a webpage, JavaScript
            will be involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            There also a lot of webpages which are almost entirely powered by
            JavaScript (i.e. where a lot of the rendering work happens in the
            browser) - those pages typically use frameworks like Angular, but
            that's a topic we'll cover later in the course. :-)
